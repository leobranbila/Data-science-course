Data science course - Udemy ( Fernando Amaral )

Most of the files have notes in Brazilian Portuguese, mainly the docx called notes. But the new files will come with the comments in English and over time I will update the existing ones to be entirely in English as well.

## About course

Course taught by Fernando Amaral - https://www.udemy.com/course/cientista-de-dados/

Course still in progress, I have currently completed approximately 60% of it, but I still have the second chapter focused on statistics, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, SQL, NoSQL, Sparl with Databricks and projects.

I will not upload any PDF files or slides from the course out of respect for the person responsible for it.
